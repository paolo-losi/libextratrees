 * Simple Pseudo-random Number Generators
 *
 * Most of these are from two newsgroup posts by
 * George Marsaglia.
 *
 * The first was in 1999 [1]. From that newsgroup post,
 * the following RNGs are defined:
 *     MWC
 *     KISS (however, instead we use Cong and SHR3 defined in the 2003 post)
 *
 * Due to analysis of SHR3 in ref [3], I believe the SHR3
 * as defined in the 1999 post should not be used. It
 * doesn't actually have a period of 2^32-1 as expected,
 * but has 64 cycles, some with very short periods. The
 * SHR3 in the 2003 post is very similar, but with two
 * shift values swapped. My suspicion is that the SHR3
 * shift values in the 1999 post are a typo.
 *
 * Since we don't use the 1999 SHR3, we may as well not
 * use the 1999 Cong either, since the 2003 Cong is almost
 * identical, but with a different added constant.
 * Therefore, we define a KISS function that uses the
 * 1999 MWC, but the 2003 SHR3 and Cong.
 * The advantage of using the 1999 MWC and KISS at all is
 * that the MWC uses only 32-bit math, while the 2003 MWC
 * uses 64-bit math which may not be suitable for small
 * embedded systems.
 *
 * The second Marsaglia post was in 2003. From that
 * newsgroup post, the following RNGs are defined:
 *     MWC64
 *     Cong
 *     SHR3
 *     KISS2
 *
 * The LFSR113 generator by L'Ecuyer is also implemented
 * [4], along with his earlier LFSR88.

/* Cong -- Congruential random number generator
 *
 * This is a congruential generator with the widely used
 * 69069 multiplier: x[n]=69069x[n-1]+12345. It has
 * period 2^32.
 *
 * The leading half of its 32 bits seem to pass tests,
 * but bits in the last half are too regular. It fails
 * tests for which those bits play a significant role.
 * But keep in mind that it is a rare application for
 * which the trailing bits play a significant role. Cong
 * is one of the most widely used generators of the last
 * 30 years, as it was the system generator for VAX and 
 * was incorporated in several popular software packages,
 * all seemingly without complaint.

/* SHR3 -- 3-shift-register random number generator
 *
 * Reading between the lines, I believe the SHR3 defined
 * in Marsaglia's 1999 post actually has a typo: the
 * shift values defined don't actually produce a period of
 * 2^32-1, but have 64 possible cycles, some extremely
 * short. But the swapped values from Marsaglia's 2003
 * post produce the full 2^32-1 period. So we use that
 * definition of SHR3.
 *
 * SHR3 is a 3-shift-register generator with period
 * 2^32-1. It uses y[n]=y[n-1](I+L^13)(I+R^17)(I+L^5),
 * with the y's viewed as binary vectors, L the 32x32
 * binary matrix that shifts a vector left 1, and R its
 * transpose.
 *
 * SHR3 seems to pass all except those related to the
 * binary rank test, since 32 successive values, as
 * binary vectors, must be linearly independent, while
 * 32 successive truly random 32-bit integers, viewed
 * as binary vectors, will be linearly independent only
 * about 29% of the time.

/* MWC1 -- "Multiply-with-carry" random number generator
 *
 * This is the MWC as defined in Marsaglia's 1999
 * newsgroup post.
 *
 * It uses two MWC generators to generate high and
 * low 16-bit parts, which are then combined to make a
 * 32-bit value.
 *
 * The MWC generator concatenates two 16-bit multiply-
 * with-carry generators:
 *
 *     x[n]=36969x[n-1]+carry,
 *     y[n]=18000y[n-1]+carry mod 2^16,
 *
 * It has a period about 2^60.
 *
 * This seems to pass all Marsaglia's Diehard tests.
 * However, it fails many of L'Ecuyer's TestU01
 * tests. The modified MWC2 generator passes many more
 * tests in TestU01, and should probably be preferred,
 * unless backwards compatibility is required.

 * Very similar to MWC1, except that it concatenates the
 * two 16-bit MWC generators differently. The 'x'
 * generator is rotated 16 bits instead of just shifted
 * 16 bits.
 *
 * This gets much better test results than MWC1 in
 * L'Ecuyer's TestU01 test suite, so it should probably
 * be preferred.

 *
 * It combines the MWC2, Cong, SHR3 generators. Period is
 * about 2^123.
 *
 * This is based on, but not identical to, Marsaglia's
 * KISS generator as defined in his 1999 newsgroup post.
 * That generator most significantly has problems with its
 * SHR3 component (see notes on SHR3 above). Since we are
 * not keeping compatibility with the 1999 KISS generator
 * for that reason, we take the opportunity to slightly
 * update the MWC and Cong generators too.
